## Step 0: Class Workspace on rstudio.cloud

Some folks are still not connected to the workspace. Reminder that this is how you get connected:

<br>
* go to http://rstudio.cloud/
* logout (top right)
* go to http://bit.ly/MATH1051_LecDemo_1

<br>
The bottom link has a special 'invite' token embedded in it, which adds you to the workspace. If you're not connected, **do this now**.
